# Rover Iteration 2: Software

| Feature | Description | Dependancies |
|---|---|---|
| Teleoperation Package | Develop a ROS package capable of moving the rover given controller/keyboard commands. Deliverables include: <br><ul><li>Send Controller Information via Ros Messages</li><li>Develop Drive Interface - Controller to Wheel Commands</li><li>Simulate Moving Rover</li><li>Test Final Package</li></ul> | <ul><li> Drive Systems: The Drive Interface must be completed before final test</li> <li>Command - We need to test sending controller msgs over command through ros</li></ul> |
| Sensor Integration | Develop and improve current sensor readouts. All sensor information must be sent over ROS messaging system, simulatable in Gazebo and visible via Rviz. <br>Deliverables include: <br> <ul><li>Camera Sensor - Send multiple camera streams over ros</li><li>Drive Sensor - Develop PID controller to retrieve odometry</li><li>IMU Sensor - Test Odometry fusion with Drive Sensor</li><li>Lidar - Develop lidar package capable of mapping and improving localisation</li><li>Realsense: Analyse and Develop a Solution that improves live mapping, navigation and odometry</li></ul>| Drive Systems/Arm Systems: we require input from these teams in order to properly develop a PID controller package and retrieve correct odometry |
| Autonomy | Analyse and Develop autonomous navigation systems and build upon sensor details. This must all be simulateable on Gazebo. Deliverables include: <br><ul><li>Detect a variety of AR Tags and use this information for localisation</li><li>Navigate against a coordinate grid: EKF</li><li>Analysis of live navigation techniques to reduce need for detailed maps or SLAM before navigation</li></ul> | Require use of the Jetson for live testing. |
| Quality of Life | Improve Command UI with debug and sensor modes, Include Arm in Teleoperation Package to allow for a more integrated and testable system (Gazebo simulation)| Dependancies on Command and arm for testing purposes |
